Our Worksheet draws inspiration from spreadsheets and visual programming. Our Dashboards draw inspiration from interactive website builders and dataflow environments.</p>
                <p className="l2cap2">As a result, our product is quite different from what came before it. This presents our team with a steady stream of exciting challenges. These in turn drive our culture of internal experimentation, great technical execution, and widespread customer empathy.</p>
